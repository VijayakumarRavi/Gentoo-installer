## Contribution

For almost any change please consider doing a few tests below.

Images should be bootable and should allow to login using root password-auth or password-less auth via SSH.

```shell
# livecd kernel with root password
USE_LIVECD_KERNEL=1 ROOT_PASSWORD=Gentoo123 ./gentoo-quick-installer.sh

# Compiled kernel with ssh public key
USE_LIVECD_KERNEL=0 SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat id_rsa.pub) ./gentoo-quick-installer.sh
